<b>✨Landing Page Project✨</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>I'm excited to share a project I recently completed—a sleek and fully responsive landing page built using HTML and CSS! 🚀
 <br>
<br> 
<b> 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used:</b>
  <br>
<br> 
HTML5: For structuring the content and ensuring accessibility.
  <br>
CSS3: To style the page with layouts, colors, and effects.
    <br>
Flexbox/Grid: For responsive and clean layout alignment.
    <br>
Media Queries: To handle responsiveness across different devices.
  <br>
<br> 
This project allowed me to sharpen my front-end development skills and gave me a deeper understanding of web design principles. 💻
